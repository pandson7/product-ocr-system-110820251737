USER REQUIREMENTS FOR AWS PRODUCT IMAGE OCR PROCESSING SYSTEM:

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
- Upload product images to AWS Storage
- Automatically trigger OCR processing when image is uploaded successfully
- Use Claude model with Bedrock to analyze product images and extract product specifications
- Extract: product name, brand, category, price, dimensions, weight, description, and any other visible product details
- Save extracted data as JSON to DynamoDB
- Provide a simple React frontend to upload images and view extracted specifications
- Setup proper IAM permissions for all service interactions.

MANDATORY END-TO-END TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Use sample image from folder "~/ea_sample_docs/ocr" for testing
- Test end to end OCR processing
- Confirm data appears in DynamoDB
- Validate frontend displays real extracted data
- **MANDATORY UI TESTING: Test the complete user workflow through the React frontend interface:**
  - Verify drag-and-drop file upload works in the browser
  - Test that processing status updates appear in real-time
  - Validate extracted product data renders properly in the UI
  - Test the "Upload Image" functionality works
  - Verify all API endpoints are accessible from the frontend (no CORS or proxy issues)

CRITICAL: Do not use mock data or images for testing. Use sample images from folder "~/ea_sample_docs/ocr" for end to end testing and necessary fixes. The solution is only complete when the entire user journey works seamlessly through the web interface.
